		// thenApply()
		// We can use this method to work with a result of the previous call. 
		// However, a key point to remember is that the return type will be combined of all calls.
	
		// So this method is useful when we want to transform the result of a CompletableFuture call:
		CompletableFuture<Integer> finalResult01 = new DifferenceBetweenThenApplyAndThenCompose().compute().thenApply(s-> s + 1);
		System.out.println(finalResult01.get()); // 26

		// thenCompose()
		// The thenCompose() method is similar to thenApply() in that both return a new Completion Stage. 
		// However, thenCompose() uses the previous stage as the argument. 
		// It will flatten and return a Future with the result directly, rather than a nested future as we observed in thenApply():
	
		CompletableFuture<Integer> finalResult02 = new DifferenceBetweenThenApplyAndThenCompose().compute().thenCompose(s -> new DifferenceBetweenThenApplyAndThenCompose().computeAnother(s));
		System.out.println(finalResult02.get()); // 35

		// So if the idea is to chain CompletableFuture methods then itâ€™s better to use thenCompose().
		// Rule of thumb here - If your callback function returns a CompletableFuture, and you want a flattened result from the CompletableFuture chain (which in most cases you would), then use thenCompose().
		// Also, note that the difference between these two methods is analogous to the difference between map() and flatMap().
